# Natours - CSS Practice Project

## Learning goals & Outcomes

- Familiarize with old and some newer css features
- Built with floats in the pre-flex-box and grid style to familiarize with older code bases
- add image rich features including looped video via CSS
- Replicate logical and aesthetically pleasing design and layout using current best-practices in html and css

## Key Features

- positioning elements
- clip-path property
- background-overlay
- "hamburger" menu css hack
- transition and transform properties for interactivity
- logical layout and strcuture for site visitors
- styling form inputs

## What I'd do differently if building again

- Use modern layout tools (Flex-box & Grid)
- optimize images and video for quicker load-times
- Re-design menu using JavaScript instead of "input" button hack for pseudo onClick menu event
